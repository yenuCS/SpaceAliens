Title: Space Aliens: The Game
Story (basics)

Rob Boss, the main character wakes up on the spaceship (USS Serenity), unknowing of his surroundings he starts exploring the ship.

(This will be the prologue, where you make a mini-game to get the player involved in the game play story and to set the initial mood 
of the environment)

Making a breathtaking escape from the monster onboard the ship, he finds himself at a console. When he tries to enter the computer he is
prompted with and Artificial Intelligence that wants to make sure that he is indeed human.
(This will also open the opportunity that others have tried to access the console (others! Ohhh… scary aye?)

When the “mission” has been solved, he now can control the ships life system. During his exploring on the console he discovers that there 
are other people on the ship, however they are completely unaware of his presence. Now there’s a question of saving these people 
from alien invaders using the airlock doors (which have to be “hacked”) and other measures. 
Rob Boss himself will of course also have problems with avoiding the aliens.

He will have 3 main missions!

1 – Save as many of the surviving people onboard the ship.

2 – Destroy the alien invaders

3 – Escape the ship (Plot Twist: The aliens catch up to him and he is killed to death.)
